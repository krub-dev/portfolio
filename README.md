# [krub.dev](https://krub.dev) — My Personal Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio, built and designed by me (Kiko, aka krub-dev), a software developer based in Barcelona, Spain.

## About This Project

This site showcases my work, skills, and interests in web development, C programming, and 3D design. It’s fully responsive, features dark/light mode, English/Spanish translation, and includes some fun easter eggs.
